    <!--    JSON (pronounced “Jay-Son”) is short for JavaScript Object Notation.

        JSON is a way to represent a specific object, using the JavaScript language.
        This can be useful in exchanging data between different computers or computer programs.
        In fact, JSON is what is known as a “data-interchange format” — a method of 
        formatting data in a manner that is easily exchanged between different computers.
        This is done by using JavaScript language instructions, in a specific format,
        to describe the various characteristics of the object that is to be exchanged.

        The JSON.stringify() method takes JavaScript objects and converts them to JSON strings.
        For data to be stored to a web server it needs to be serialized (converted into a string).
        In other words, the data needs to be converted from an object to a string format.

        The code above has an object “dog” with key/value pairs.
        For this data to be saved on a web server, the keys and their values
        need to be converted to string formats.
    
        In our code, the JSON.stringify() method took the key objects and
        the string values and converted them into string formats for the web browser
        to properly read. -->

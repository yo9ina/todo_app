    <!--
    localStorage() is a JavaScript method that will store data locally
    in the web browser without the need for utilizing a separate database.
    The data will persist in the browserâ€™s memory and the data will not be deleted
    even if the web browser has been closed.
    Local storage doesn't get sent back and forth with every HTTP request
    and so it speeds up webpage load time.
